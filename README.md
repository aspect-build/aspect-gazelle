# Aspect Gazelle - BUILD generation

## Gazelle Languages

### JavaScript

See [language/js](./language/js).

### Aspect Extensions

The [language/orion](./language/orion) package provides a Gazelle `Language` implementation enabling Aspect Extension Language (AXL, a Starlark dialect) for writing extensions

## Gazelle Enhancements

We provide a variety of enhancements to Gazelle.

The [runner](./runner) enables these enhancements automatically, otherwise manual setup (including patching Gazelle) is required.

### Gitignore

Support for `.gitignore` when generating BUILD files, enabled by the `# gazelle:gitignore enabled|disabled` directive.

### Caching

File based caching of any file analysis by Gazelle language implementations.

Basic caching can be enabled by setting the `ASPECT_CONFIGURE_CACHE` environment variable to a path (e.g. `~/.cache/aspect-gazelle.cache`) for loading+persisting the cache between Gazelle runs.

Further functionality includes [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) and other utilities for Gazelle language implementations.

See the [common/cache](./common/cache)

### `--watch` mode

The [runner](./runner) supports a `--watch` mode that uses [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) to monitor the filesystem for changes and regenerate BUILD files as needed. This automatically enables the watchman based caching provided by the [common/cache](./common/cache) package.

## Prebuild

### Why prebuild?

Gazelle is commonly built from source on developer's machines, using a Go toolchain.
However this doesn't always work well.

Here's a representative take:

https://plaid.com/blog/hello-bazel/

> A week later, reports started coming in from users complaining that running the tool was taking too long, sometimes multiple minutes. This took us by surprise â€“ the team had not encountered any slowness in the 6 months leading up to that moment, and the generation was only taking a handful of seconds in CI. Once we added instrumentation to our tooling, we were surprised to find a median duration of about 20 seconds and a p95 duration extending to several minutes.

Not only can it be slow, it can often be broken. That's because Gazelle extensions don't have to be written in pure Go.

For example see this issue, where the Python extension depends on a C library called TreeSitter, which forces projects to setup a functional and hermetic cc toolchain:

### Install

1. Configure Bazel to fetch the binary you need from our GitHub release. There are a few ways:
  - We recommend using [rules_multitool](https://github.com/theoremlp/rules_multitool) for this; see the release notes on the release you choose.
  - Simplest: `http_file` with a `native_binary#select`
  - https://dotslash-cli.com/

2. Verify that you can run that binary from the command-line, based on the label.

For example with rules_multitool:

```sh
$ bazel run @multitool//tools/gazelle
```

3. Add a `gazelle` target to your `BUILD` file, referencing the label from the previous step.

```starlark
load("@gazelle//:def.bzl", "gazelle")

gazelle(name = "gazelle", gazelle = "@multitool//tools/gazelle")
```

4. Continue as normal from the [gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle) setup docs.

5. When you want to update to a new version, use [multitool](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/multitool): `multitool update tools.lock.json` to update the lockfile.
