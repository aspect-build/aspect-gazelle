Failed to validate dependencies for target "@tsx_css_not-found//:tsx_css_not-found":

Import "/abs/styles.css" from "main.tsx" is an unknown dependency. Possible solutions:
	1. Instruct Gazelle to resolve to a known dependency using a directive:
		# aspect:resolve [src-lang] js import-string label
		   or
		# aspect:resolve_regex [src-lang] js import-string-regex label
		   or
		# aspect:js_resolve import-string-glob label
	2. Ignore the dependency using the '# aspect:js_ignore_imports /abs/styles.css' directive.
	3. Disable Gazelle resolution validation using '# aspect:js_validate_import_statements off'

Import "./styles.css" from "main.tsx" is an unknown dependency. Possible solutions:
	1. Instruct Gazelle to resolve to a known dependency using a directive:
		# aspect:resolve [src-lang] js import-string label
		   or
		# aspect:resolve_regex [src-lang] js import-string-regex label
		   or
		# aspect:js_resolve import-string-glob label
	2. Ignore the dependency using the '# aspect:js_ignore_imports ./styles.css' directive.
	3. Disable Gazelle resolution validation using '# aspect:js_validate_import_statements off'
